👋 Hi! I'm Krystal and I'm an accountant for a public pension system. 

✍️ I've been self-studying computer programming concepts using Python since 2017 and am finally at the point where I'm writing code that I can use to automate my job more. 

🤔 Why would I want to automate repetitive tasks, thus eliminating the need for me to possibly have a job to begin with you may ask? 

🤷‍♀️ I just don't like doing mundane and/or manual accounting work. I'm automating my job so that I don't have to do the boring parts of my job. I want to do more analytical commentary, but I can only do that if I get rid of the boring stuff.

👁️ All my repositories are private at this point, but as I learn how to use GitHub and get more projects that are not elementary, I'll begin creating public repositories.

😃 Thanks for reading! Happy coding!
